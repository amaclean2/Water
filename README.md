# Database interaction layer for Sunday Peak

## Here's how this works

- To initialize, there's a class called `SundayService`. Create an instance of this and initialize with your sql parameters and a jwt secret, then you're good to go
- There's a layer called `services` that handles all the formatting and grouping requests into a cohesive interaction layer with the database
- `Services` has a few classes that handles the majority of the traffic coming to the backend
- Those send requests to the database layer: `DB/.` to store or retrieve the information from the database
- If stuff needs to be cached, that happens in `services`

### Rules to follow

- Data going to/from the database should be formatted with underscores instead of camelCase
- Stuff should usually be tested. I've gotten above 80% coverage, still need to write more sad path tests and error responses
- More design docs could be useful for this. Right now, I'm just trying to get stuff out.

**Example:**

```javascript
const serviceHandler = new SundayService(<sqlParameters>, <jwtSecret>)
const userHandlers = serviceHandler.userService
const adventureHandlers = serviceHandler.adventureService
// ...todoHandlers, messageHandlers, passwordHandlers, completedHandlers
```

## To set up a development environment with `SundayPeak/rivers` or `SundayPeak/couloirs`

inside `BackyardFriends` run

```shell
docker volume prune
docker compose -f compose-dev.yaml build
docker compose -f compose-dev.yaml up
```

then you can `cd` into `rivers` or `couloirs`

inside the host app run the following commands

```shell
npm link @amaclean2/sundaypeak-water
npm i -s ../../Water
npm run dev
```

now you can develop with this repository in real time
